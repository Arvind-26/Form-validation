# Form Validation Project

---

### **Overview**
This project involves creating a form with robust client-side validation using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The form collects essential user information such as Full Name, Email ID, Phone Number, Password, and Confirm Password, ensuring all inputs meet the required validation criteria. Any errors trigger descriptive messages to guide users in correcting their input.

     - ‚ÄúEnter a valid email.‚Äù
     - ‚ÄúPassword is not strong.‚Äù
4. **Dynamic Feedback**:
   - Validates fields on input change and form submission.
5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Built with **CSS Flexbox/Grid** and **Bootstrap** for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
